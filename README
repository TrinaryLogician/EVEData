Hello user :)

My name is Trinary Logician (in-game: Trinary Logician, Trinary Atruit, DarqueRogue), and
this is a program I am developing for my corporation that I thought might be found useful
by others, and such I am releasing this under GPLv2 (once I get around to it)

The idea is that this program will have two sides: On one side, a database of information
in regards to whatever is needed by the corp of the program. Then, there will be a stand-
alone program with handles user input, and a IGB viewing platform. This is for easy of
access to information for corps, fleets and users alike
